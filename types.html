                    <h2>primates</h2>

                    <p>Primate, in zoology, any mammal of the group that includes the lemurs, lorises, tarsiers, 
                        monkeys, apes, and humans. The order Primates, including more than 500 species,
                        
                        is the third most diverse order of mammals, after rodents (Rodentia) and bats (Chiroptera).</p><br>

                        <p>  Fossils of the earliest primates date to the Early Eocene Epoch (56 million to 41.2 million years ago) 
                            or perhaps to the Late Paleocene Epoch (59.2 million to 56 million years ago). Though they began as an
                             arboreal group, and many (especially the platyrrhines, or New World monkeys) have remained thoroughly 
                             arboreal, many have become at least partly terrestrial, and many have achieved high levels of intelligence.
                             s certainly no accident that the most intelligent of all forms of life, the only one capable of constructing
                              the Encyclopædia Britannica, belongs to this order.</p>

                <h2>panda's</h2>

                <p>The charismatic giant panda is a global conservation icon and the symbol of our organisation. Thanks to decades of successful conservation work, wild panda numbers are starting to recover, but they remain at risk. Human activities continue to be the biggest threats to their survival. An extensive giant panda nature reserve network exists, but one-third of all wild pandas live outside of protected areas in small isolated populations.

                    Pandas typically lead a solitary life. They're excellent tree climbers,<br> but they spend most of their time feeding. They can eat for 14 hours a day, mainly bamboo, which is 99% of their diet (though they sometimes eat eggs or small animals too).
                    
                    Giant pandas are living proof that conservation works. And even better, by protecting pandas we’re also helping protect the wider environment where they live, for all the wildlife and the people that depend on it.</p>

                <h1> Deers</h1>

                <p>
                    Deer, (family Cervidae), any of 43 species of hoofed ruminants in the order Artiodactyla, notable for having two large and two small hooves on each foot and also for having antlers in the males of most species and in the females of one species. Deer are native to all continents except Australia and Antarctica, and many species have been widely introduced beyond their original habitats as game animals. One species, the reindeer (also known as the caribou), has been domesticated. Some swamp and island species are endangered, but most continental species are flourishing under protection and good management. Deer,
                     when granted some protection, readily exploit man-made disturbances caused by agriculture, forestry, and urbanization
